If you're interested in writing a TCP/IP stack in Python I would recommend you use Python raw sockets, or possibly dnet[1] or pcapy[2].
On second thought you really need to use raw sockets if you want this to work

Requests uses the socket library under the hood at times, as does urllib.

Tasks:
* set up Wireshark
  - capture some packets and read a pcap file
  - set up rules to capture just some packets so it's easy to find the ones I create
* use the socket library to send a echo (to google?) with some arbitrary data
* use the socket library to send a ping (to google?)
* use the socket libary to initiate a TCP connection
